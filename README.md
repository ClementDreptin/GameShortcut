# GameShortcut

GameShortcut is a utility to build shortcuts to games in the Games section of the regular Xbox 360 dashboard. The main purpose of GameShortcut is to avoid opening XeXMenu and browsing your files to launch a game.

## Prerequisites

- Having the Xbox 360 Software Development Kit installed
- Xbox 360 Neighborhood set up with your RGH/Jtag/Devkit registered as the default console

## How to use

- Download the latest release in the [releases section](https://github.com/ClementDreptin/GameShortcut/releases).
- Modify `config\gameInfo.txt` and respect the following format
    ```
    <shortcut_name>
    <path_to_xex>
    ```
- Run `Publisher.exe`
- Reboot your console and go the Games section of your dashboard to see your shortcut

## How it works

This project is split in two. The first part is the shortcut application itself (that runs on the console) and the second part is a Windows console application (that runs on a computer) to build the shortcut and send it to the console.

The shortcut application is a regular XEX file, so not exactly a shortcut just yet. All it does is reading the `config\gameInfo.txt` file to get the path to the XEX file the shortcut is made for and launches it.

The Windows console application creates an XML configuration file from the name of the shortcut in `config\gameInfo.txt` and builds a Demo game for it with BLAST (console application provided with the XDK). BLAST takes care of deploying the Demo game to the console in the right directory. When the operation completes (successfully or not), the XML configuration file and the files generated by BLAST are deleted automatically.
